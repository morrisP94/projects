In this project you can choose from the various of the recipes around the world and see all neccessary ingredients for the recipe, the origin of the recipe, you tube video of the recipes as well. You can create your own recipe and save it on the local server where all recipes data are stored permanently. I have used JavaScript for coding and HTML and CSS for webpage and Node.js for creating a local server.
